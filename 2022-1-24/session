Session Objects

	The Session object allows you to persist certain parameters across requests. It also persists cookies across all requests made from the Session instance.

	A Session object has all the methods of the main Requests API.

Request and Response Objects

	Whenever a call is made to requests.get() and friends, you are doing two major things. 

	First, you are constructing a Request object which will be sent off to a server to request or query some resource.

    Second, a Response object is generated once Requests gets a response back from the server.

		>>> import requests
		>>> r = requests.get('https://www.bayut.com/to-rent/property/dubai/')
		>>> r.headers
               {
               	headers:   ..............  ..........
               }


		>>>r.request.headers

		{'User-Agent': 'python-requests/2.27.1', 'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate', 'Accept': '*/*', 'Connection': 'keep-alive'}

Basic operations

Arithmetic operators
comparison operators
Logical Operators
Bitwise Operators
Assignment Operators

		if test expression:
           Body of if
        elif test expression:

Loops

while loop

	while expression:
    statement(s)

for in Loop
   for iterator_var in sequence:
    statements(s)

Nested Loops
	for iterator_var in sequence:
    for iterator_var in sequence:
        statements(s)
        statements(s)

Break Statement: It brings control out of the loop

Pass Statement: We use pass statement to write empty loops. Pass is also used for empty control statement, function and classes.

Function

Class
Object

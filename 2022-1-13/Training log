Data hiding 

	In Python, we use double underscore (Or __) before the attributes name and those attributes will not be directly visible outside. 

One of the major advantages of Object Oriented Programming is re-use.

Class Method
The @classmethod decorator is a built-in function decorator that is an expression that gets evaluated after your function is defined. 

Static Method
A static method does not receive an implicit first argument. 

To define a class method in python, we use @classmethod decorator, and to define a static method we use @staticmethod decorator. 

Python Functions is a block of related statements designed to perform a computational, logical, or evaluative task. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputsfunctions

	def function_name(parameters):
    	"""docstring"""
    	statement(s)
   	    return expression

 We can create a  Python function using the def keyword.

 Types of Arguments

 A default argument is a parameter that assumes a default value if a value is not provided in the function call for that argument.

 Variable-length arguments
	In Python, we can pass a variable number of arguments to a function using special symbols. There are two special symbols:

	*args (Non-Keyword Arguments)
	**kwargs (Keyword Arguments)


Functional Programming in Python

 It uses expressions instead of statements. An expression is evaluated to produce a value whereas a statement is executed to assign variables.

 Concepts of Functional Programming

 Pure Functions:they always produce the same output for the same arguments irrespective of anything else. 

 Recursion: There are no “for” or “while” loop in functional languages. Iteration in functional languages is implemented through recursion.

 Variables are Immutable: In functional programming, we can’t modify a variable after it’s been initialized. We can create new variables – but we can’t modify existing variables.
